# 📚 AI Study Buddy

An AI-powered PDF Question Answering application built using **Streamlit, FAISS, Sentence Transformers, and Groq LLM**.

Upload any PDF document and ask questions about its content. The application uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to find relevant information from the document and generate accurate answers.

## 🧠 How the RAG Pipeline Works

### Step 1: PDF Upload

User uploads a PDF document.

### Step 2: Text Extraction

PyPDF extracts text from each page.

### Step 3: Chunk Creation

Large text is divided into smaller overlapping chunks.

Example:

```text
Chunk 1 → Characters 1–500
Chunk 2 → Characters 401–900
Chunk 3 → Characters 801–1300
```

### Step 4: Embedding Generation

Each chunk is converted into a numerical vector using:

```text
all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

### Step 5: Vector Storage

Vectors are stored inside FAISS.

### Step 6: User Question

Question is converted into an embedding.

### Step 7: Similarity Search

FAISS retrieves the most relevant chunks.

### Step 8: Answer Generation

Retrieved chunks are sent to Groq LLaMA 3.1.

The model generates an answer using only the retrieved context.
